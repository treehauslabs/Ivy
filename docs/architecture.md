# Ivy Architecture

This document describes how Ivy is built. It is grounded in `Sources/Ivy/` — every
message type, config field, transport, and limit below is taken from the code. For the
conceptual model (identity, economics, trust, pinning, security) see the
[whitepaper](whitepaper.md).

## Overview

Ivy is a content-addressed P2P storage and retrieval network. One `Ivy` instance is a
single Kademlia overlay: a node with one identity (a Curve25519 public key), one routing
table (`Router`), one reputation ledger (`Tally`), and a set of peer connections. All data
on the wire is **content-addressed** — a CID is the cryptographic hash of its bytes, and
every received `(CID, bytes)` pair is verified with `hash(bytes) == CID` before use
(`ContentAddressVerifier`). Schema-aware interpretation of those bytes lives above Ivy, in
the consuming application (cashew / Lattice).

## Actor Decomposition

The node is one Swift `actor`, `Ivy`, split across four files so that the actor's mutable
state and message dispatch live in one place while feature areas stay readable. All
extensions share the same actor isolation; the split is organizational, not architectural.

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `Ivy.swift` | Façade and transport glue: lifecycle (`start`/`stop`), connection management, dialing, the identify handshake, the central `handleMessage` dispatch, sending primitives, single-CID block fetch, local-peer wiring, the inbound TCP listener, and all pending-continuation bookkeeping. |
| `Ivy+Routing.swift` | DHT iterative lookup (`findNode`), Peer Exchange (PEX), and discovered-endpoint admission (`isAcceptableDiscoveredEndpoint`). |
| `Ivy+ContentExchange.swift` | DHT forwarding (`handleDHTForward`), volume-aware fetching (`want`/`blocks`, `announceVolume`/`pushVolume`), high-bandwidth push, and provider records. |
| `Ivy+Records.swift` | Pin announcements (`findPins`/`pins`/`pinAnnounce`) and signed `NodeRecord` storage, lookup, and expiry. |

The actor holds all routing-adjacent mutable state directly: `connections`, the various
`pending*` continuation maps (requests, volume requests, forwards, PEX, neighbor lookups,
findPins, node-record requests), `providerRecords`, `pinAnnouncements`, `nodeRecordCache`,
the gossip token buckets, and reconnect bookkeeping. Several of these are bounded
(`BoundedDictionary`, `BoundedSet`, `InventorySet`) so that an adversary cannot drive
unbounded allocation by asking for unique CIDs or flooding announcements.

## Transports

### TCP (peer transport)

The only peer-to-peer transport is TCP, built on SwiftNIO. `PeerConnection` wraps a NIO
`Channel`. Every message is a length-prefixed frame:

```
┌──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│ 4 bytes: length      │ length bytes: payload      │
│ (big-endian uint32)  │ (tag byte + fields)        │
└──────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

`MessageFrameDecoder` reassembles frames from the TCP stream, rejecting any frame whose
length is `0` or exceeds `maxFrameSize` (closing the channel). `PeerChannelHandler` feeds
decoded `Message` values into a per-connection `AsyncStream` (bounded at 256 buffered
messages, newest-wins). The actor drains that stream in `handleInbound`.

Outbound sends come in two flavors:
- `send(_:)` — `async`, awaits the channel write/flush.
- `fireAndForget(_:)` / `fireAndForgetMessage(_:)` — enqueue without awaiting, used for
  gossip and relayed responses where back-pressure is handled at a higher layer.

There is no UDP peer transport and no separate relay-circuit transport in the code. "Relay"
in Ivy means **DHT message forwarding** (see Content Routing) — a `dhtForward` hops through
intermediate peers' existing TCP connections; there is no dedicated circuit object, lifetime,
or byte cap.

### In-process transport

`LocalPeerConnection` is a paired, in-memory channel (`AsyncStream` in each direction) for
co-located services that want to talk to the node without a socket. `LocalServiceBus`
registers a named local service, creating a connection pair and registering the node side
as a `localPeer`. Local peers participate in the same message dispatch as TCP peers but
bypass the Tally send budget (they are trusted, co-located).

### Inbound connections

`startListener` binds a NIO `ServerBootstrap` on `0.0.0.0:listenPort` (backlog 256). New
channels get a `MessageFrameDecoder` + `InboundConnectionAcceptor`; the acceptor calls
`handleNewInboundChannel`, which registers the peer under a placeholder
`inbound-<UUID>` identity. The real identity is learned from the peer's `identify`
message. An inbound peer that fails to identify within 30 seconds is disconnected, as is
any inbound connection accepted when already at `tallyConfig.maxPeers` capacity.

## NAT Traversal (STUN)

Ivy's only NAT facility is STUN address discovery. `STUNClient` (a UDP `DatagramBootstrap`)
sends an RFC 5389 binding request to the first responsive server in `stunServers`
(default: `stun.l.google.com`, `stun1.l.google.com`, `stun.cloudflare.com`) and parses the
`XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS` (or `MAPPED-ADDRESS`) attribute, with a 3-second per-server timeout.

On `start()`, the discovered `ObservedAddress` is stored as `publicAddress` and reported via
`delegate.ivy(_:didDiscoverPublicAddress:)`. It is advertised in `identify` `listenAddrs`
and used to build the node's signed `NodeRecord`.

There is no AutoNAT, hole punching, or UPnP in the code. A signed `identify` authenticates
*who* sent an address claim, not whether that address is reachable — so only locally
verified STUN discovery is allowed to mutate `publicAddress`/`NodeRecord`. There is no
default UDP listen port; UDP is used transiently only for outbound STUN queries.

## The Identify Handshake

Immediately after a connection is established (both directions), each side sends an
`identify` frame: its public key, the observed remote host/port, its listen addresses, its
advertised child-chain ports (`chainPorts`), and a Curve25519 signature over
`publicKey ‖ observedHost`.

`handleIdentify` enforces:
1. **Signature required.** An empty or invalid signature is rejected and the peer
   disconnected — no peer may claim a key it cannot sign for. Keys may be raw 32-byte hex
   or Multikey-prefixed (`ed01…`, 68 chars); the prefix is stripped for verification.
2. **Optional key-PoW floor.** If `minPeerKeyBits > 0`, the peer's key must have at least
   that many trailing zero bits in `SHA256(publicKey)` (`KeyDifficulty.trailingZeroBits`),
   raising the cost of Sybil routing-table poisoning. Each bit doubles expected key-gen work.
3. **Identity rebind.** Inbound peers start under a placeholder `inbound-<UUID>` ID; on a
   valid identify the connection, router entry, health tracking, and credit line all migrate
   to the real `PeerID`.

`chainPorts` advertised by a peer are stored in `peerChainPorts`, letting a node discover
the exact listen port a peer uses for a given child-chain directory without recomputing it.

## Content Routing

### Trust-weighted routing table (`Router`)

`Router` is a Kademlia table: 256 buckets indexed by the common-prefix length between the
local node's `SHA256(publicKey)` and the peer's. Bucket size is `kBucketSize` (default 20).
XOR distance over the SHA-256 hashes orders peers; `closestPeers(to:count:)` returns the
globally closest entries to a target hash or string.

Eviction is standard Kademlia: a full bucket keeps its existing live contacts; a newcomer
is dropped rather than displacing an established peer. A bucket slot is freed only by
explicit removal on liveness failure or disconnect. (Tally reputation gates *who gets
served and routed to*, via `shouldAllow`, rather than rewriting bucket membership.)

The router also provides the hashing primitives used throughout: `hash` (SHA-256),
`commonPrefixLength`, `xorDistance`, `isCloser`, a bounded `hashCache`, and
`destinationHash(name:identityHash:)` for name-addressed routing targets.

### Single-CID fetch

`get(cid:)` and the internal `fetchBlock(cid:)` resolve one CID. The path:
1. Try the local `IvyDataSource` first.
2. `fetchViaDHT` — register a pending continuation, send `dhtForward(cid, ttl: defaultTTL)`
   to the `maxConcurrentRequests` closest reachable peers (or up to 3 arbitrary peers if
   none are close), and arm a `relayTimeout`.
3. `fetchWithNewConnections` — if still unresolved, dial closest-by-XOR peers and retry
   with `ttl: 0` (direct, no further forwarding), arming a `requestTimeout`.

A matching `block` response wakes all waiters coalesced on that CID. `getDirect(cid:from:)`
and `get(cid:target:)` are targeted variants that record success/failure against a specific
peer in Tally, so a peer that announces content and then fails to deliver is demoted.

### Relay-first DHT forwarding

`handleDHTForward` is the forwarding core. On receiving `dhtForward(cid, ttl)` from a peer:
- Gate on `tally.shouldAllow(peer:)` and credit capacity; otherwise reply `dontHave`.
- If the CID is in `haveSet` and the `IvyDataSource` produces the bytes, reply `block`
  (and credit the peer with distance-scaled byte accounting + relay metering).
- Else if `ttl > 0`, register the requester in `pendingForwards` and re-forward
  `dhtForward(cid, ttl-1)` to the 3 closest reachable peers (excluding the requester and
  self). When the data later arrives via a `block`, `resolveForwards` fans it back to all
  pending requesters.
- Else (`ttl == 0`, not held) fail silently — the requester has its own timeout.

`pendingForwards` is bounded globally (`maxPendingForwards = 4096`) and per-peer
(`maxPendingForwardsPerPeer = 128`), each entry self-expiring after `requestTimeout`.

### Volume fetching

A "volume" is a content-addressed bundle keyed by a root CID — the root plus the child
CIDs reachable from it. Ivy treats volumes as opaque: any peer can satisfy a root request
by returning matching `(CID, bytes)` pairs, and pending volume fetches are keyed by root
CID, never by peer.

```
Requester                                   Provider(s)
   │  want([rootCID])  or  wantVolume(rootCID, [childCIDs])
   │ ─────────────────────────────────────────►
   │                                            (IvyDataSource.volumeData)
   │  blocks(rootCID, [(cid, data), …])         │  or  notHave(rootCID)
   │ ◄─────────────────────────────────────────
   │  verify every hash(data)==cid, require root present
   │  first valid responder wins; wake coalesced waiters
```

`fetchVolume(rootCID:)` checks the local data source, then `fetchVolumeFromNetwork`, which
builds a candidate list in priority order: known providers (`providerRecords`) →
locally-stored pin announcements → DHT-discovered pinners (`findPinnersViaDHT`) → a
broadcast fallback over direct peers capped at `maxWantCandidates` (default 8). It then
sends `want`/`wantVolume` to candidates and awaits the first valid `blocks` response.
`handleBlocks` verifies each item, inserts verified CIDs into `haveSet`, records the
provider, and resolves the request; a `notHave` retires that candidate, and when all
candidates are exhausted the request resolves empty early instead of waiting for timeout.

The responder side, `handleWant`, serves only volumes it actually holds (the root must be
present) and trims the response so the serialized `blocks` frame stays under `maxFrameSize`
(`budgetedWantItems`), prioritizing the root CID. Fetch requests coalesce: concurrent
callers for the same root join one in-flight request (capped at `maxWaitersPerPendingCID`).

## Gossip and Announcements

### Block announcements

`announceBlock(cid:)` / `publishBlock(cid:data:)` insert the CID into `haveSet` and
broadcast `announceBlock(cid)` to all connected peers. On receiving an announcement,
`handleMessage` (for `.announceBlock`):
- Rate-limits per-peer relay via a token bucket (`admitGossipRelay`, capacity 200, refill
  50/s) so one peer cannot drive unbounded broadcast amplification.
- If the CID is new, marks it in `haveSet`, fires a `dhtForward(cid, ttl: 0)` back to the
  announcer to pull the data, and re-broadcasts the announcement to other peers.
- Notifies `delegate.ivy(_:didReceiveBlockAnnouncement:from:)`.

### Inline block push

`sendBlock(cid:data:)` broadcasts the full `block(cid, data)` inline to every connected
peer, bypassing the Tally send budget. It is the unsolicited push of freshly-produced
content, eliminating the announce → request round trip. (There is no separate
`BLOCK_PUSH` message type — it reuses the `block` frame.)

### Volume announcements and high-bandwidth push

`publishVolume(rootCID:items:)` implements a BIP-152-style high-bandwidth path: it
proactively pushes the entire volume (`pushVolume`) to the top `highBandwidthPeers`
(default 3) by Tally reputation, and sends lightweight `announceVolume(rootCID, childCIDs,
totalSize)` metadata to the rest. Receivers of `announceVolume`/`pushVolume` verify content,
record the provider, dedup by root, and gossip the announcement onward (rate-limited).

### Peer exchange (PEX)

When `enablePEX` is set, `startPEX` runs a periodic loop (first round after 30s, then every
`pexInterval`, default 120s). Each round picks a random connected peer and sends
`pexRequest(nonce)`; the peer answers `pexResponse(nonce, peers)` with up to `pexMaxPeers`
(default 16) endpoints drawn from the closest entries to the requester's hash. Discovered
endpoints are admitted through `isAcceptableDiscoveredEndpoint` (non-empty key, routable
host/port, not self, optional key-PoW floor) and then dialed.

PEX responses are only accepted for a nonce we actually issued; unsolicited responses are
logged and dropped, and a response whose endpoints don't all pass admission demotes the
sender in Tally.

## Peer Connectivity Lifecycle

### Dialing and diversity

`connect(to:)` reserves the dial (`reserveOutgoingDial`), which enforces **/16 subnet
diversity**: at most 2 connections per /16 (first two host octets) across active and
in-progress dials, mitigating eclipse attacks. On success the peer is added to the router,
a credit line is established, health tracking starts, the inbound loop launches, and an
`identify` is sent.

### Reconnection

When a non-inbound connection drops while the node is running and the disconnect was not
intentional, `scheduleReconnect` retries with exponential backoff: base 500ms, doubling per
attempt (shift capped at 10), capped at 30s, plus up to 250ms jitter. `disconnect(peer)`
marks the peer intentionally disconnected (suppressing reconnect), cancels pending work,
removes it from the router, and notifies the delegate.

### Peer health

`PeerHealthMonitor` is a separate actor. Every `keepaliveInterval` (default 60s) it pings
idle peers with a nonce; a peer is declared stale after `maxMissedPongs` (default 3) missed
pongs or `staleTimeout` (default 180s) of silence, at which point the `onStale` callback
disconnects it. Activity (any inbound message) and matching pongs reset the counters and
feed `Tally` success/failure signals.

## Identity and Reputation

### Peer identity

A `PeerID` (from Tally) is a Curve25519 public key. `Ivy.generateKey(targetDifficulty:)`
brute-forces a keypair whose hex public key has at least `targetDifficulty` trailing zero
bits — Ivy's own PoW difficulty tiers for Sybil resistance (distinct from any chain's
block target).

### Reputation (`Tally`)

All reputation accounting is delegated to the `Tally` dependency and is purely local — there
is no global reputation authority. Ivy feeds Tally `recordRequest`, `recordSent`,
`recordReceived` (with the content/peer common-prefix length for distance-scaled credit),
`recordSuccess`, and `recordFailure`, and gates serving and relaying on
`tally.shouldAllow(peer:)`. Inbound capacity, gossip-bucket sizing, and high-bandwidth peer
selection all read from Tally as well.

### Credit lines

`CreditLineLedger` (constructed with `baseThresholdMultiplier`) tracks bilateral byte-metered
credit per peer. `handleDHTForward` and the volume handlers `earnFromRelay` /
`chargeForRelay`, and `hasCreditCapacity` can refuse to relay for a peer whose line needs
settlement. The cooperative defaults make this transparent; the design space (paid relay,
settlement) is covered in the [whitepaper](whitepaper.md).

## Node Records

A `NodeRecord` is a signed, versioned identity→endpoint mapping (public key, host, port,
sequence number, issued/expires timestamps, Curve25519 signature), serialized to at most
340 bytes with a default and maximum TTL of 24 hours. Records are:
- **Self-signed only** — created by the key owner with `signingKey`; `verify()` checks the
  signature, future-skew (≤ 300s), and expiry.
- **Sequence-resolved** — a higher `sequenceNumber` supersedes a cached record for the same
  key; expired records are evicted.
- **Query-propagated, not gossiped** — served in response to `getNodeRecord(publicKey)` and
  piggybacked on the identify handshake. `lookupNodeRecord` asks the closest reachable peers
  and waits briefly. The cache (`nodeRecordCache`) is bounded at 5,000 entries.

`updateNodeRecord` is driven by STUN-confirmed `publicAddress` changes; `handleNodeRecord`
accepts a record only from its owner or in response to a request we issued, after signature,
size, and sequence checks.

## Multi-Chain Deployment

A single `Ivy` instance is one overlay. In a multi-chain host like Lattice, each chain runs
its own `Ivy` overlay (its own keyspace, routing table, and peer set), and a node simply
runs one `Ivy` per chain it participates in. The cross-chain link surfaces in Ivy through
`chainPorts`/`peerChainPorts` in the identify handshake: a node advertises the listen ports
of the child chains it serves, so a peer that already serves a parent chain can be dialed
directly for a newly-discovered child chain without a fresh discovery round. The full
per-chain overlay and parent-child bootstrap model is documented in the
[whitepaper](whitepaper.md) and in the `lattice-node` docs.

## Wire Protocol

### Framing

Every message is a length-prefixed frame: a big-endian `uint32` length followed by the
payload, whose first byte is a tag. Fields are big-endian; strings and data blobs are
length-prefixed (`uint16` length for strings, capped at 8 KB; `uint32` length for data,
capped at `maxFrameSize`); counts are `uint16` and bounded per message
(`MessageLimits`). Frames exceeding `maxFrameSize` are rejected at decode time.

### Message catalog

Tags are the on-wire `Message.Tag` raw values. Direction: `→` request/outbound,
`←` response/inbound, `↔` either way / gossip. (`isKeepalive` messages — `ping`, `pong`,
`identify` — always send regardless of the Tally budget.)

| Message | Tag | Payload | Dir |
|---------|:---:|---------|:---:|
| `ping` | 0 | `uint64` nonce | ↔ |
| `pong` | 1 | `uint64` nonce | ↔ |
| `block` | 3 | CID + data | ↔ |
| `dontHave` | 4 | CID | ← |
| `findNode` | 5 | target hash + `uint64` fee + `uint64` nonce | → |
| `neighbors` | 6 | array of (key, host, port) + `uint64` nonce | ← |
| `announceBlock` | 7 | CID | ↔ |
| `identify` | 8 | publicKey + observedHost + observedPort + listenAddrs + chainPorts + signature | ↔ |
| `dhtForward` | 16 | CID + `uint8` ttl + `uint64` fee + optional target + optional selector | → |
| `want` | 26 | array of root CIDs | → |
| `pexRequest` | 37 | `uint64` nonce | → |
| `pexResponse` | 38 | nonce + array of (key, host, port) | ← |
| `findPins` | 40 | CID + `uint64` fee | → |
| `pins` | 41 | CID + array of provider public keys | ← |
| `pinAnnounce` | 42 | rootCID + publicKey + `uint64` expiry + signature + `uint64` fee | → |
| `pinStored` | 43 | rootCID | ← |
| `deliveryAck` | 46 | `uint64` requestId | ↔ |
| `peerMessage` | 49 | topic + payload | ↔ |
| `blocks` | 50 | rootCID + array of (CID, data) | ← |
| `wantVolume` | 53 | rootCID + array of child CIDs | → |
| `announceVolume` | 54 | rootCID + child CIDs + `uint64` totalSize | ↔ |
| `pushVolume` | 55 | rootCID + array of (CID, data) | ↔ |
| `nodeRecord` | 56 | serialized `NodeRecord` | ↔ |
| `getNodeRecord` | 57 | publicKey | → |
| `notHave` | 58 | rootCID | ← |

The `fee`/`target`/`selector` fields on `findNode`/`findPins`/`pinAnnounce`/`dhtForward`
are wire-reserved for the credit-line / selector model; the current handlers default them to
zero / ignore them. Several historical tags are explicitly retired in the source: tag 2
(`wantBlock`, replaced by `dhtForward(ttl:0)`), 9–14 (AutoNAT dial-back and zone/have-volume
messages), 21–31 (chain-specific), 35–36 (mining challenge), 44–45/47–48/51 (fee/balance/
settlement messages of the older economic layer).

## Application Interface

A consumer wires two protocols:

- **`IvyDataSource`** — supplies local content to serve: `data(for:)`, `volumeData(for:cids:)`,
  and `hasVolume(rootCID:)`. Set via `setDataSource`.
- **`IvyDelegate`** — receives events: `didConnect`/`didDisconnect`, `didReceiveBlock`,
  `didReceiveBlockAnnouncement`, `didReceiveVolumeAnnouncement`, `didReceiveMessage` (for
  `pins`/`pinStored`/`deliveryAck`/`peerMessage`/`notHave`), and `didDiscoverPublicAddress`.
  All methods have default no-op implementations.

Free-form application messaging rides on `peerMessage(topic:payload:)` via `sendMessage`
(to one peer) and `broadcastMessage` (to all), delivered through `didReceiveMessage`.
