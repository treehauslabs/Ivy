/// A parent process's attestation that it spawned a child process: a signature
/// by the parent (issuer) over the child's public key and the chain-path scope
/// the child was spawned to serve. Certificates compose along the process tree
/// into a chain rooted at the top process's key, so a grandchild can prove
/// spawn-tree membership to any ancestor (`SpawnCertificateChain.verify`).
///
/// Trust follows provenance: a connection backed by a valid chain to a key the
/// verifier trusts as its tree root classifies as trusted; everything else is
/// federated.
///
/// ## Caller preconditions (handshake wiring — separate PR)
/// - **`leaf` MUST be a possession-proven identity** — the public key of the
///   authenticated connection (bound by the identify-signature handshake), NEVER
///   a field lifted out of the presented chain. The chain is supplied by the
///   connecting (untrusted) peer; verifying it proves spawn-tree membership of
///   the asserted `leaf`, not that the presenter holds `leaf`'s private key.
/// - **Enforce the proven scope.** Use `verifiedScope` (not just the `verify`
///   Bool): a peer proven only for `["Nexus","a"]` must not be trusted to inject
///   consensus data for other chains. The strict-prefix nesting is only
///   meaningful if the caller bounds the peer to `verifiedScope`'s result.
/// - **No temporal validity / revocation in the primitive.** A certificate has
///   no expiry, epoch, or nonce, and the holder assembles its own chain — so a
///   compromised child keeps presenting a still-valid chain. "Revocation" is the
///   VERIFIER ceasing to trust the root (or a specific key), not the holder
///   dropping a cert. On-wire revocation (an expiry/epoch field bound into the
///   signed material + a verifier-side freshness check) is a wiring-PR concern.
///
/// ## Canonical signing payload
/// The signature covers a deterministic, length-prefixed encoding — never JSON —
/// so there is no field-boundary ambiguity (`["Nexus","AB"]` and
/// `["Nexus","A","B"]` encode differently):
///
///     lp(domain) || lp(canonical child key) || lp(canonical issuer key)
///     || count(chainPath) || lp(element)…
///
/// where `lp` is the UInt16-big-endian length prefix used by Ivy's wire format,
/// `count` is a UInt16 element count, and keys are canonicalized to raw hex
/// (`ed01` Multikey prefix stripped) so both spellings of a key sign and verify
/// identically. Keys/signatures are the same Curve25519 (Ed25519) scheme Ivy
/// peers already use for identity.
